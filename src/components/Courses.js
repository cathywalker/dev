      <h1>Courses</h1>
      <div>I am almost finished creating 2 courses to host on the likes of Udemy. One for translation of Angular to React and one for the opposite, React to Angular. Having studied and created projects personally and professionaly in both I felt I was perfectly situated to develop them, and hopefully other Devs can get value from them. They will be live in 2025.
        <h2>Topics include:</h2>
        
          <p>- Inputs to props</p>
          <p>- ng-content to children</p>
          <p>- ngClass to useState and style</p>
          <p>- ngIf to conditional rendering</p>
          
      </div>
    </div>
  );

export default Courses;
