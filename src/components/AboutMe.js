      <div>
          I have been a Professional Web Developer for 18 years. I have had a passion for Computers and Technology since I was a child and went to my father's office which was filled with computers and programmers.

        <p>I knew my future lay in Web Development as I loved learning about and implementing the techonology so much, and it had such a rich UI in comparison to other computing areas at the time. Since then I have kept up to date with latest Libraries, Frameworks and changes in languages. My main technologies at the minute are React, JavaScript, TypeScript, SCSS, and Tailwind.</p>
