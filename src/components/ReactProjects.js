      <h1>React Projects</h1>
      <div>I began developing in React in 2015. I was getting lots of Freelance work and wanted to give my clients the latest technology so as best to future proof their site. In 2016 I began to work for a company again, that was Client based, that was able to secure even more work and most of those websites they requested were built in React. Since then I have kept up to date with all the changes to the Library. I coded in a team on a large scale space management website with React. <p>Below is a taster of my some of my other projects with links to GitHub, as is this very website itself:</p> </div>

        <h2>AirBnB Clone</h2>
        <p>I saw the CEO of the space management web app firm I wanted to work for speak and heard him say his favourite website was Airbnb for UI and UX. So to impress him and show him I could do the job I built a clone of it. That is what convinced him to hire me:</p>
